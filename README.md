### 8) Kafka with below features:
#### Publish-Subscribe Messaging:
#####      Utilize Kafka's publish-subscribe model to enable multiple consumers to subscribe to the same topic and receive copies of messages.
#### Message Serialization:
#####      Configure message serialization and deserialization to convert complex data structures to and from the byte streams that Kafka uses for communication.
#### Message Partitioning:
#####      Use partitioning to distribute messages across multiple brokers for scalability and parallel processing. Implement custom partitioners if needed.
#### Consumer Groups:
#####      Utilize consumer groups to scale horizontally and distribute message processing workload across multiple instances of a consumer within the same consumer group.
#### Offset Management:
#####      Handle offset management to keep track of the position of the last consumed message in each partition. This ensures that consumers can resume from where they left off.
#### Dead Letter Queues:
#####      Implement dead letter queues or error-handling mechanisms for messages that couldn't be successfully processed by consumers.
#### Batch Processing:
#####      Use Kafka for batch processing scenarios by consuming messages from topics that store batches of data.
